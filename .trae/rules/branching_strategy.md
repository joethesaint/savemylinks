# Git Branching Strategy - SaveMyLinks

## üå≥ Branch Structure Overview

This document outlines the branching strategy for the SaveMyLinks project, establishing clear workflows for development, feature integration, and production releases.

---

## üìã Branch Hierarchy

### **Main Branches**

#### 1. `main` - Production Branch
- **Purpose**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Protection**: Protected branch, requires PR reviews
- **Deployment**: Automatically deployed to production
- **Updates**: Only receives merges from `enhancements` branch

#### 2. `dev` - Secondary Main Branch (Development Hub)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for ongoing development
- **Role**: Primary development branch where new features are integrated
- **Updates**: Receives merges from feature branches
- **Stability**: Should always be in a working state
- **Testing**: All features must pass tests before merging

#### 3. `enhancements` - Final Integration Branch
- **Purpose**: Final staging before production
- **Role**: Receives polished features from `dev` for final review
- **Updates**: Periodically updated from `dev` when features are ready for production
- **Quality Gate**: Final testing and validation before `main`

## üîÑ Workflow Process

### **Feature Development Workflow**

```
1. Create feature branch from `dev`
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/0x##-feature-name

2. Develop and test feature
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Regular commits with hex indexing

3. Create PR to merge into `dev`
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Code review and testing

4. Merge to `dev` after approval
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Feature is now part of development integration

5. Periodically merge `dev` ‚Üí `enhancements`
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ When features are ready for production staging

6. Merge `enhancements` ‚Üí `main`
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production release
```

### **Branch Naming Conventions**

#### Feature Branches
```
feature/0x##-brief-description
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/0x13-user-authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/0x14-bulk-operations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/0x15-analytics-dashboard
```

#### Bugfix Branches
```
bugfix/0x##-brief-description
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/0x16-rate-limit-fix
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/0x17-cache-invalidation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/0x18-cors-headers
```

#### Hotfix Branches (Emergency fixes)
```
hotfix/0x##-brief-description
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/0x19-security-patch
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/0x1A-critical-bug-fix
```

## üöÄ Development Process

### **Starting New Development**

1. **Always branch from `dev`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/0x##-feature-name
   ```

2. **Regular development**:
   ```bash
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "[0x##] Brief description of change"
   git push origin feature/0x##-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Target: `dev` branch
   - Include: Description, testing notes, changelog entry
   - Review: Required before merge

### **Integration to Production**

1. **Dev to Enhancements** (Weekly/Bi-weekly):
   ```bash
   git checkout enhancements
   git pull origin enhancements
   git merge dev
   git push origin enhancements
   ```

2. **Enhancements to Main** (Release cycles):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge enhancements
   git tag v1.x.x
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

## üìù Commit Message Standards

### **Format**
```
[0x##] Brief description (50 chars max)

Detailed description of changes made.
Include any breaking changes or migration notes.

Closes: #issue-number (if applicable)
```

### **Examples**
```bash
# Feature commit
git commit -m "[0x13] Add JWT authentication system

Implemented user login/logout with JWT tokens.
Added middleware for protected routes.
